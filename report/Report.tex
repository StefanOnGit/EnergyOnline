	A very important part are reliable measurements of energy production and consumption. It would be ideal, if smart meters could provide the data directly to the network. But it's highly possible that this does not work yet. As the trust in ewz is very high, and they already check energy consumption manually, this is a service ewz might provide.

	Another problem might be on the legal front. The DAO is still a young concept with no laws existing yet. There is also the question, of how the certificates are handled in such a system.
